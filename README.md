# 🧪 PowerShell Encoded Command Threat Hunting Lab

## 📌 Overview

This lab simulates an attacker using an encoded PowerShell command (`-EncodedCommand`) to execute a potentially malicious payload. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and KQL, I simulated the attack and hunted for the encoded command activity within Defender logs. This lab walks through simulation, detection, and basic remediation logic.

## ⚙️ Event Creation

### 🎭 Threat Simulation

A harmless PowerShell command was encoded in Base64 and executed using the `-EncodedCommand` flag to simulate obfuscated attacker behavior. This is a common evasion tactic in real-world attacks.

#### 💻 Command Used:
```powershell
powershell -EncodedCommand VwByAGkAdABlAC0ATwB1AHQAcAB1AHQAIAAiAFMAdQBzAHAAaQBjAGkAbwB1AHMAIABQAG8AdwBlAHIAUwBoAGUAbABsACAAQQBiAHUAcwBlACAAUwBpAG0AdQBsAGEAdABpAG8AbgAiAA==
```

This command decodes to:
```powershell
Write-Output "Suspicious PowerShell Abuse Simulation"
```

## 🔍 Detection via KQL

### 🧠 Query Used:
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(2h)
| where FileName endswith "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "-EncodedCommand"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## 🧩 Device Onboarding

The virtual machine was onboarded to Microsoft Defender using a custom script provided by the lab environment. This step ensured logging of PowerShell activity in Defender for advanced hunting.

## 🛡️ Remediation (Simulated)

If this were a real attack, these steps would follow detection:

- 🔍 Review full process tree and timeline
- 🕵🏽 Investigate parent and child processes
- 🚫 Isolate the endpoint if malicious behavior is confirmed
- ❌ Terminate the suspicious process
- 📦 Quarantine downloaded files
- 🚨 Escalate per incident response procedures

## 📝 SOC-Style Incident Report

**Title**: Suspicious Encoded PowerShell Command Detected  
**Analyst**: Fee Bolden  
**Date**: June 2, 2025  
**Device**: blueteamwin10  
**User**: system

### ⚠️ Alert Type:
Suspicious Command-Line Activity

### 🧪 Behavior:
A PowerShell process was executed with the `-EncodedCommand` flag, commonly used by attackers to hide malicious scripts in Base64 format.

The decoded command in this instance was harmless:
```powershell
Write-Output "Suspicious PowerShell Abuse Simulation"
```

No additional payloads or network connections were observed.

### 🔍 Actions Taken:
- Investigated device timeline in Microsoft Defender
- Verified that no additional processes or file drops occurred
- Confirmed activity was part of a controlled simulation
- No remediation required

### 📌 Lessons Learned / Next Steps:
- In the real world, I'd add custom detection for encoded PowerShell usage
- I'd also recommend monitoring for follow-up behaviors (like downloads or reverse shells)
